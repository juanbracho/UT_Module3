# Module 3: Python Programming

## Overview
In this module, we transitioned to programming with Python. The focus was on understanding the basics of Python, including command-line interface usage, file handling, loops, conditionals, dictionaries, and functions. This module introduced foundational programming skills essential for data analysis and automation.

## Challenge Details
This challenge consists of two parts: **PyBank** and **PyPoll**.  
1. **PyBank**: Analyze financial records to calculate key metrics such as total profit/loss, average changes, and the greatest increase and decrease in profits over time.  
2. **PyPoll**: Develop a Python script to modernize a voting process, tallying votes from a dataset to determine the total votes, percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner.

## Skills/Tools Used
- **Tools**: Python 3, Command Line Interface (CLI)
- **Techniques**:
  - File I/O: Reading and writing CSV and text files
  - Loops and conditionals
  - Dictionaries and lists
  - Basic statistical calculations

## Instructions/Key Steps
### PyBank:
1. Read a financial dataset (`budget_data.csv`).
2. Calculate:
   - Total months included in the dataset.
   - Net total amount of "Profit/Losses".
   - Average change in "Profit/Losses".
   - Greatest increase in profits (date and amount).
   - Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount).
3. Print the analysis to the terminal and export it to a text file.

### PyPoll:
1. Read an election dataset (`election_data.csv`).
2. Calculate:
   - Total number of votes cast.
   - A complete list of candidates who received votes.
   - The percentage and number of votes each candidate won.
   - The winner based on the popular vote.
3. Print the election results to the terminal and export them to a text file.

## File Descriptions
- **budget_data.csv**: Dataset of financial records for PyBank.
- **election_data.csv**: Dataset of election results for PyPoll.
- **main.py**: Python script containing the solution for both challenges.
- **analysis.txt**: Exported text file with the results for both challenges.

## Conclusions/Learnings
- Developed a solid understanding of Python programming concepts, including loops, conditionals, and file handling.
- Gained experience working with CSV files and exporting outputs.
- Learned to structure Python scripts for analysis and reporting.
